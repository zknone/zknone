### 📈 Key Achievements (Working experience)

* **Performance Optimization:** Boosted rendering speed for heavy-load screens by 60% through advanced memoization (React.memo, useMemo) and selector optimization. Improved load times for key scenarios by 15-25% by optimizing API interactions and state management.
* **System Architecture:** Architected and refactored a resilient, modular WebSocket layer for telemedicine systems, replacing a legacy 5000+ line codebase to ensure message delivery stability and simplified scalability.
* **Real-time Communication & WebRTC:** Implemented comprehensive Real-time functionality for sending, editing, forwarding, and answering messages and media, as well as managing chats and channels. Integrated WebRTC to enable high-quality in-platform audio and video consultations. 
* **Advanced Chat Features:** Developed instant messaging, media exchange, and real-time statuses (online/typing).Created complex UI elements, including virtualized message lists and custom context menus using React Portals.
* **Technical Debt Reduction:** Led the refactoring of 30+ legacy components (3000+lines each) and established a UI-kit with 70+ reusable elements, cutting code duplication by 50%.
* **Type Safety:** Achieved 100% type safety in chat modules by eliminating "any" types and migrating the project to TypeScript Strict Mode.
* **Mobile Development:** Developed MVP and corporate tools using React Native and Expo, integrating native modules such as camera, geolocation, and background tasks.
* **Leadership & Mentoring:** Spearheaded code review processes (30+ PRs) and mentored 4 interns, assisting them with onboarding and task decomposition.

### 📂 Portfolio Highlight (Freelance or pet projects)

* **[Valentin Diakonov — Art Critic Portfolio](https://yick.art/en)**
    * **Role:** Lead Frontend / Product Engineer.
    * **Tech Stack:** Next.js, TypeScript, Sanity.io.
    * **Key Contributions:** Engineered a high-performance full-stack web application with seamless content management. Acted as a Product Engineer by pitching features, collaborating with designers, and managing the project lifecycle to align with user needs.
      
* **[Incredibly Cool Game (Vampire Survivors Clone)](https://github.com/orange1072/incredibly-cool-game)**
    * **Role:** Lead Engine Developer / Frontend Architect.
    * **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, OOP, Redux Toolkit (RTK Query), Canvas API.
    * **Engine Architecture:** Designed and implemented a custom **[modular game engine](https://github.com/orange1072/incredibly-cool-game/tree/dev/packages/client/src/engine)** using TypeScript and OOP. Developed a flexible system based on **mixins**, allowing the creation of game mechanics and entities (player, enemies, projectiles) by composing independent modules: collisions, health systems, AI behaviors, spawning logic, and camera management.
    * **Rendering System:** Developed a high-performance **Canvas API rendering engine** from scratch. Implemented a world-rendering pipeline, camera management (follow/zoom logic), and optimized sprite rendering for high-density mob scenes.
    * **State Management & UI:** Developed a custom [adapter](https://github.com/orange1072/incredibly-cool-game/tree/dev/packages/client/src/engine/adapters) to synchronize core game engine states with the React UI. Implemented all [states](https://github.com/orange1072/incredibly-cool-game/tree/dev/packages/client/src/store/slices/game) needed. Integrated forum API using Redux Toolkit's **[createApi](https://github.com/orange1072/incredibly-cool-game/tree/dev/packages/client/src/api)** (RTK Query) for seamless data fetching and caching.

* **[Messenger Framework & Chat App](https://github.com/zknone/ws-chat-advance)**
    * **Role:** Lead Software Engineer.
    * **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, OOP, Handlebars, Vite, Mocha/Chai.
    * **Architectural Innovation:** Developed a custom **Single Page Application (SPA) framework** from scratch, featuring a self-written Router, State Management (Store), and a Block-based component system for Handlebars.
    * **Engineering Excellence:** Implemented private routing, persistent sessions, and real-time messaging via WebSocket.
    * **Quality Assurance:** Maintained high code standards with a 100% type-safe codebase, strict ESLint/Stylelint rules, and automated unit testing (Mocha/Chai/jsdom) for core framework modules.
